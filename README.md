# Facebook Chat Bot Demo

This demo shows the manual integration with [Facebook Messenger](https://developers.facebook.com/) and 
[API.ai](https://console.api.ai) using webhook.

This bot allows you to create, join, or leave a group on Facebook Messenger.<br>
However, to use it, you'll have to open a server. (It's closed now. I used [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to open one) <br>
Also, change the urls in both facebook messenger and api.ai. (as shown below)
